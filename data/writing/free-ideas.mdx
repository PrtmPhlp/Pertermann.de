Time is limited on Earth, so here are some quick shower thoughts of apps/side projects you could build:

- **Whisper**
  - an app that converts speech into notes
  - you can manually edit text, but only optionally, audio should be first
  - just brain dump ideas:
    - hold for quick ideas
    - tap for continuous recording
  - pinch out from note view to see the list of notes

- **Mutual Agreement Meetings**
  - make an app where you send a link to meeting attendants, they should vote if the meeting should take place or not
  - three modes (set by the meeting host):
    - democratic: a majority of votes say no => cancel the meeting
    - all in all votes have to say yes => meeting takes place
    - totalitarian: the majority of votes say no => meeting takes place
  - all anonymous, only seen by   people that youâ€™ve shared the link with
  - connect zoom / meet account to delete the meetings 

- **Global Pomodoro Timer**
  - there exists only one, global, pomodoro timer: 25 minutes of focus, 5 minutes of break
  - use it and study alongside other people/friends
  - chat with people during breaks
  - manipulate the timer based on the no. of sessions

- **Green Light, Red Light Typer**
  - wpm typer, but you can only type when it's green light
  - press one character when it's a red light to instantly lose
  - the game becomes to the most practical, not to the fastest typer

- **Tapes**
  - users could make a video, and others could post their video on top of that
  - imagine reddit r/all image where it was a mayhem
    - this would be the global February tape for example
  - where each user could, for free, add like 10 seconds of video and audio if he wants
  - he could overwrite the current video or add it to the end
  - you could make private tapes with friends (max. 5)
  - create vlogs together, videos, etc.
  - add filter-based themes
    - users could only tape if their phone points to 130 degrees south
    - only if the red% of the image is > 250 and brightness is < 50
    - only if there are 12 degrees
    - only if they scan a QR code in the video

Share with me on Twitter if you got any inspiration from those app ideas! Will add more soon...
