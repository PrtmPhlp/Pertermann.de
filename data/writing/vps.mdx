When choosing a VPS for your cloud projects, performance and cost-effectiveness are key considerations. The VPS which hosted this for about a year ran on a 
2 GB 1 vCPU DigitalOcean Droplet. In December i decided to give Hetzner a try and I’m impressed by the results which are reflected by both an increase in performance but also a 3x price decrease

These are the results for all VPS options using Geekbench benchmarks

1. **DigitalOcean (1 CPU Core, 2GB RAM)**
    - Cost: **15€**/month
    - Single-core score: **911**
    - Multi-core score: **915**

2. **Hetzner CX22 Intel (2 CPU Cores, 4GB RAM)**
    - Cost: **4,50€**/month (3,92€ + 0,60€ IPv4)
    - Single-core score: **733**
    - Multi-core score: **1276**

3. **Hetzner CAX11 Ampere (2 CPU Cores, 4GB RAM)**
    - Cost: **4,50€**/month (3,92€ + 0,60€ IPv4)
    - Single-core score: **1045**
    - Multi-core score: **1893**

## Cost vs. Performance

| Provider               | Cost (€/month)   | Single-Core Score | Multi-Core Score | Performance per Euro (Single-Core) | Performance per Euro (Multi-Core) |
|------------------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| DigitalOcean           | 15               | 911               | 915              | 60.7                               | 61                                |
| Hetzner CX22 Intel     | 4.5              | 733               | 1276             | 162.9                              | 283.6                             |
| Hetzner CAX11 Ampere   | 4.5              | 1045              | 1893             | 232.2                              | 420.7                             |


- **Hetzner CAX11 Ampere** provides the best overall value, delivering the highest single-core and multi-core performance at just 4,50€/month.
- **Hetzner CX22 Intel** is also a great value and probably more practical for legacy x86 tasks 
- **DigitalOcean**, while decent in single-core performance, is hard to justify at three times the cost of Hetzner's offerings.

## Conclusion

For those prioritizing raw performance per euro, Hetzner's VPSs clearly outshine DigitalOcean Droplets. The CAX11 Ampere and CX22 Intel offer great value for general workloads.

While I had a good experience with DigitalOcean, its pricing and performance are a pretty bad deal compared to services like those Hetzner provides. I’m currently running this site on the CX22 mainly because of some x86-only binaries but am considering switching to the ARM option.
